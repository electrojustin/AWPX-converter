A quick application for viewing and converting AWPX image files.

To build:
Just type 'make'

Usage:
./viewer <filename>
Open up <filename>

./converter <input filename> <output filename>
Change AWPX image file <input filename> into PNG file <output filename>

Limitations: operates under the assumption that there's no compression,
there is only one layer, there are no options, and the format is RGBA, but the
alpha channel is always 0. This is how most if not all of the files are
structured. Requires libpng for converting, OpenGL and glut for viewing, and 
a POSIX environment. Only works on little endian systems.

Feel free to do anything you want with the code. There are improvements to be
made, obviously. I tried to document the code in the comments, but if you have
any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me. My email is just
